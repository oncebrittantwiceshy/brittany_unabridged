<div class="facts first">sunday bruncher.
This is a long one: 
Me and my friend would bruch every weekend when 
we were living in the same town. if we went to 
one particular restaurant I ordered the crab cake 
benny and if we went to our other fave place I would 
order chicken and waffles. And always mimosas no 
matter where I am. One weekend we weren't able to go out
so I ordered brunch from a new place that claimed
it specialized in Southern comfort food. I got
the chicken and waffles. Big mistake. If you've ever 
eaten legit fried chicken and been to a fish fry 
(not simultaneously) then you KNOW you're supposed to use
different breading for each. Why did this restaurant 
use the fish type of breading on the fried chicken. My mind
and my mouth could not make sense of the combo. That was 
just about the most disappointed I've ever been in my 
whole entire life.</div>

<div class="facts">sugar addict.
Every south Floridian knows
that no other grocery store compares
to Publix (except maybe Whole Foods 
but we're not talking about organic at
the moment.) And they have really good 
glaed doughnuts. I said all of that to say
this: Publix doughnuts trumps Krispy Kreme.
Chnage my mind. And I'm dying to try
